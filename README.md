# GOBCC Newsletter Guide

This is a guide or walkthrough for creating, editing, and sending out the **Gains/Oldham Black Culture Center's** weekly newsletter.


## Links
Below are the links that you will need, besides your email, to do everything needed to create the newsletters:

**1.) MailChimp:** This is the website you will be able to create, edit, and send the newsletter to different individual emails that are currently subscribed on the audience list.
**[Mailchimp login page]https://login.mailchimp.com/?_ga=2.24094714.1304667710.1620750626-416748358.1620750626**

**2.) PDF to PNG:** When you are getting different emails with other center's events, they will often send the images as PDFs and MailChimp cant use those. With this website, you will able to change images that you receive in a PDF( secured document tag) format to a PNG (image tag) which allow you to use those images.

### Audience
This page is where you will be able to add mainly your email to ensure that you receive the newsletter drafts as you send out for either edits or to send to everyone. You can access the audience page by pressing the *Icon with the shapes and smiles* which is located under the pencil icon on the dashboard.

### Creating/Replicating Newsletters  
Once you click on the mailchimp link above you will brought to their login page. Type in the current login information and you will be brought to the main page. From here you start your own newsletter from scratch by clicking the *Pencil icon* that is at the top of the dashboard on the left hand side of the screen
<!-- ![Dashboard: Create Button]() -->

If you want to use the past newsletters as a template, you can do this by clicking the *Megaphone icon* on the dashboard which should be the third button from the top. 
<!-- ![Dashboard: Champaign Button]() -->

On the next page you will see all the past newsletters we have on the current account starting with the latest one worked on. You are able to replicate any past newsletters by clicking the dropdown arrow located next to the *View Report* button on right hand side of each individual newsletter.
<!-- ![Individual newsletter example]() -->

Once you replicate the newsletter you want, the page should reload to the replicated newsletter.  One this first page you will be able to edit:

 - The name of the newsletter
 - Who you want to send it to (subscribed contacts in the audience)
 - Where it will be sent from
 - Subject
 - Content of the actual newsletter

### Editing Newsletter
Once you have those first four fields changed to the way you need them, you'll ready to move on to the content part where you will spending the most of your time. Once you click the *Edit Design* button you will be brought to this screen here:
<!-- ![Newsletter Content page]() -->

On the left hand side you will see different *Blocks* that you can click and drag to the place you want within the newsletter. Once you drag what you want to the newsletter the edit options will replace the other blocks on the right hand side, so you will be able to edit the dragged block as you like.

As you hover you mouse over the different parts of the newsletter you will see that each part of it is a block that can be clicked and dragged, edited, duplicated, and deleted. Each of the options pop up at the top of each individual block when hovered over or clicked on.
<!-- ![Content of Newsletter]() -->
Try dragging and dropping different blocks to see how each works through its editing options and the way it looks on the newsletter.
**Side note:** you can switch the view on the right hand side by clicking one of the options titled *Blocks* *Style* *Options*.

**Changing images from PDF:** If you have received images in the PDF format, go to the PDF to PNG website. Once you are there you can either look up the image on your computer or just drag and drop it in the box under the *Upload files* button.

### Sending out first draft for edits
Once you have the newsletter the way you want, press the teal *Continue Button* on the top right hand corner of page. You will be brought back to the page you were at before you started to edit the newsletters content. Double check that you are sending the newsletter to the right person/email. 

On the first draft you want to send it to yourself to see how it will look as is and to recieve the link to the newsletter on mailchimp. Once you recieve this link, click it, and copy the entire newsletter and paste it into Word or a text editing software. Save it to place you can easily find it because you will be sending that document plus the link to whoever is appointed to checking over the newsletter at this time. Once the person sends back the Word doc with their edits, replicate the newsletter you made and add in the different changes they have made. 


### Sending out final draft
Once you made sure all the edits have been made and it looks the way you want, you'll be ready to send it out to everyone. To do this you will press the *Send Button* to send to the GOBCC's main email(muoslbcc@umsystem.edu). Once the email comes through on the center's email, forward the email to (gobcc_events@po.missouri.edu). Make sure to clean up any unnecessary information added from forwarding the email. Make one last check that it looks the way you want, then send it out.
Congratulations, you sent out your first newsletter!!
**Side Note:** make sure that the email is subscribed in the audience to send it the final draft. For some reason the email becomes unsubscribed each week. 
 
 If you have any questions or unsure of anything on mailchimp, there is a black button with a question mark at the bottom of each page and you will be able to type in what you are looking for.
